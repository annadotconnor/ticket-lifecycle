Welcome to osTicket, or if you're here from the previous lab, welcome back :) We will start at the agent dashboard. Throughout this lab we will demonstrate the support ticket life cycle, from user creation of a suppor ticket, to agent resolution. 
</p>
<br><br>

Click Open a New Ticket, and choose one of the users you previously created. Choose Business Critical Outage as the topic, and you can choose your scenario or use what I have entered above. Scroll down and hit Create Ticket.
</p>
<br><br>

<p>
Now that we have support tickets created we will log out, and log back in as one of our agents to work the ticket.
</p>
<br><br>

Please enter the username and password credentials you created for your agent. If you username does not work, try the email you created for that agent.

We are now in Jane's dashboard. If Jane were a real support agent, this is what she would see at the start of her work day. All users are shown that submitted suport tickets, and currently all tickets are at a "Normal" priority level. 
</p>
<br><br>

<p>

</p>
<p>
From here Jane will begin to assign the tickets to either herself or other agents in the department as well as update the priority level and SLA.
</p>
<br><br>

<p>
Jane has chosen to assign the first ticket to herself. 
</p>
<br><br>

<p>

</p>
<p>
She will now assign the SLA.
</p>
<br><br>

<p>

</p>
<p>
She has determined this is a business impacting event, and appropriately chosen SEV-A.
</p>
<br><br>

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iKFU5Ee.png">
</p>
<p>
She must now assign this ticket to a Department.
</p>
<br><br>

<p>

</p>
<p>
She has updated this ticket to System Administrators as this would be an elevated urgency, and the subject matter is the responsibility of the Sys Admins.
